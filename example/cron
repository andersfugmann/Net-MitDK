# This renews a lease every 10 minutes, for all profiles.
# If cannot, it dies, once, hoping that the notification reaches you via cron/mail.
# Further expiration notices are suppressed not to spam you
#
# Remember the full path! $PATH is not initialized in cronjobs.
# Also, you probably don't want log redirection - if it will fail to
# reauthenticate, it will die, but only once, so you'll get a notification
# with cron mail.
